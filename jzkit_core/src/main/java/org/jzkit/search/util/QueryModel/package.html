Every query model must be able to instansiate itself from an internal query, and to create
an internal query representation of itself. This means that given a query in one model, we
should always be able to convert (Subject to translation, and possibly a lossy process) from
one query model into another. For efficiencies sake, when creating a new representation from
an existing one, it may be beneficial to always check that the base classes are actually *different*
before going through the possibly losy transformation. However, since each service description
might have it's own rules for creating queries from internal representations, the rules governing
transformations may be different from (For example) Z39.50 target to target, and not just, say,
from CQL to Z39.50 type-1 queries.
