<h3>For Teachers</h3>
<h4>What is Curriculum Online?<a id="whatiscol" name="whatiscol">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>Curriculum Online is an online catalogue of priced and free multimedia resources at <a title="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/ href=" href="<%=base_dir%>">http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a> that support the teaching of the Curriculum in England up to Key Stage 4. The <abbr title="Department for Education and Skills">DfES</abbr> is providing &pound;330m, between 2002 and 2006, to Government-funded nursery, primary and secondary education in England to spend on these resources.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>Is my school receiving funding?<a id="ismyschool" name="ismyschool">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>Each <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> in England has been given money using Standards Fund Grant 31c for pupils in the following areas of government maintained education -</p>
<ul>
<li>Nursery</li>
<li>Primary</li>
<li>Secondary</li>

<li>Special schools</li>
<li>Pupil Referral Units</li>
<li>Non-mainstream providers such as Hospital schools and Travellers Education Services</li>
</ul>

<p>The money is known as <a href="<%=base_dir%>/abouteLearningCredits"><abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr></a> and is paid as cash to <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> based on how many schools and pupils are in their area. Each maintained school is entitled to &pound;1000 as a starting point plus around &pound;9.73 per pupil between Foundation and Key Stage 4. All other institutions with maintained places are not entitled to the &pound;1000 baseline figure and should ask their <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> if they are entitled to a pupil allocation based on maintained places.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> must either transfer the money to their schools' budgets or hold the money centrally with the schools' agreement to make bulk purchases. Schools may also combine <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocations for larger purchases.</p>

<p>To find out if your school has received its allocation, you should first check with the budget holder at your school. Then, if necessary, talk to your <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> and speak to the individual or team who distributes Standards Fund money. If you still cannot find the answer, please contact the Becta helpdesk by completing an <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/ContactUs/QueryForm.htm">enquiry form</a> or by telephone on 0845 054 0099.</p>

<h4>When do we have to spend our <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs?</abbr><a id="spendelcs" name="spendelcs">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>All Standards Fund grants must be <q>spent</q> by the end of the academic year to ensure their effective use. If the money has not been spent by the deadline, the <abbr title="Department for Education and Skills">DfES</abbr> will reclaim the money from <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> so it can be redistributed to other areas.</p>

<p>In practise "spent" means that schools must have either placed orders for resources or paid for ordered resources by 31 August. If an invoice is yet to be received and/or paid prior to 31 August, then the expenditure should be recorded as "committed" in the school accounts. The outstanding invoices can then be paid after 31 August.</p>

<h4>What am I allowed to buy?<a id="tobuy" name="tobuy">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p><abbr title="eLearning Credit">eLCs</abbr> can only be spent on educational multimedia resources advertised on the <a href="<%=base_dir%>">Curriculum Online website</a></p>

<p>The site displays thousands of multimedia resources, many of which are free. Each resource will have been approved for Curriculum Online by a registered supplier and is specifically aimed at teaching the Curriculum from Foundation to Key Stage 4.</p>
<p>These resources may also be advertised in registered suppliers' catalogues and can be bought directly from the supplier. If a resource is displaying the Curriculum Online logo it is an eligible Curriculum Online resource.</p>

<h4>What is a multimedia resource?<a id="multimedia" name="multimedia">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>We broadly define a multimedia resource as an item of software or a web site that requires a subscription, and is specifically targeted to support the teaching of the Curriculum in England through enriching lessons with the latest technology. It may be supplied in many different formats and at a wide range of prices. </p>

<p>The resource may include items such as user manuals, technical support and the cost of distribution. It is unlikely though to include any items of hardware  as these are not allowed unless they cost only a small fraction of the cost of the software and are sold as a package.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>How do I find and buy resources?<a name="buyresources" id="buyresources">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>On the home page you can do each of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm">Select a subject on the home page to access a subject search page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Subjects/SEN/Subject.htm">Find resources for pupils with SEN</a></li>
<li><a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Subjects/FYr/Subject.htm">Find resources for Early Learning/Foundation Stage</a></li>

<li><a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Subjects/SWR/Subject.htm">Find whole school resources such as reference materials</a></li>
<li>Use the A-Z <a href="<%=base_dir%>/spplier">Supplier Search</a> index to look for a particular supplier and their resources</li>
<li><a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/TitleSearch/TitleSearch.htm">Search for a title of a resource</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On each subject search page you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search by Key Stages and school years</li>
<li>Select the size of resource that you are looking for</li>
<li>Enter key words and additional search options to make your search more specific</li>

<li>Browse resources based on the Programme of Study/Scheme of Work</li>
<li>The search results give details of each resource and link to the websites of suppliers.  Follow the link to the supplier's website to find out how to order the resource.</li>
<li>If the resource is priced, please tell the supplier if you are using your <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money to buy it. Using <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money to pay for resources does not alter the supplier's ordering, distribution or invoicing system nor does it prevent suppliers from offering discounts to customers.</li>
<li>When you have received the resource, the supplier will invoice your school directly. The invoice should be paid using your existing procedures and the expenditure recorded in your school's accounts under Standards Fund Grant 31c.</li>
<li>If the resource is available free of charge, details will be displayed on either the resource information page and/or the supplier's site describing how to obtain it.</li></ul>

<h4>Why can't I buy hardware?<a id="cantbuyhardware" name="cantbuyhardware">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>Curriculum Online is aimed at raising standards in Curriculum subjects by giving teachers software that will help them teach in the classroom. If we allowed the money to be spent on other items, we might not achieve this aim.</p>
<p>If your school needs hardware or any other item that we do not provide, please talk to your <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> to see if other budgets are available.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>Can I buy Microsoft's resources?<a id="microsoft" name="microsoft">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>The only eligible Microsoft resource is Encarta, the multimedia encyclopaedia. This is because Encarta contains content that is specifically relevant to the Curriculum.</p>
<p>Microsoft's more generic resources such as the Office suite are not eligible. If you need funds to purchase Microsoft Office or its site licence, please talk to your <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> to see if other budgets are available.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>Can my privately run nursery receive <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs?</abbr><a id="nursery" name="nursery">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<p>Private, voluntary and independent providers of nursery education will need to meet the following conditions if they are to receive an  <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocation of around &pound;9.70 per eligible place:</p>

<ol class="lettered">
<li>They meet the criteria for inclusion in the Education Authorities' Directory of all non-maintained providers;</li>
<li>are registered and have been inspected by Ofsted, and have had their provision assessed as being satisfactory or better;</li>
<li>have eligible three and four year-olds in receipt of the Nursery Education Grant who are eligible for free nursery education;</li>
<li>have appropriate hardware in place, such as computers or electronic whiteboards, through which to run multimedia content;</li>
<li>the calculated amount due to provider is &pound;50 or more.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you meet the conditions above you will need to contact your <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr>. However pleased be advised that meeting these conditions alone does not guarantee that you will receive funding. The <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> funding is limited and we are asking <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> to distribute it to an ever growing number of providers. <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> have to look at their priorities right across the maintained and non maintained sectors and allocate accordingly. We provide general guidance but the final responsibility with regard to the allocation of funds rests with the <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>For <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr></h3>

<h4>Can you give me guidance on calculating <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocations?<a id="guidance" name="guidance">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>Each year, Chief Education Officers and Early Years Teams within each <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> are sent guidance on how to calculate and distribute <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr> to schools and nurseries for the current academic year.

<h4>I need information on all of the <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> grants available to schools<a id="ictgrants" name="ictgrants">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>Each year, the <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> in Schools division publishes guidance on Standards Fund Grant 31 that covers the provision of hardware, software, internet connections and Hands on Support to schools. <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/ictinschools/funding" title="ICT teaching materials guidance">Copies of the guidance</a> can be found.</p>

<h4>Why are private nurseries now eligible for <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocations?<a id="privatenurseries" name="privatenurseries">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>Private nurseries have been eligible for <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocations since 2003 but we are aware that some <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> have not been aware of this fact. It is essential that all eligible nurseries regardless of their setting receive an <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocation that has been calculated fairly. Please refer to the <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Helpdesk/eLCGuidance20052006.htm" title="eLC allocation guidance">current guidance on <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocations</a></p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>We have allocated all our eLCs to our maintained schools/nurseries but are receiving further requests for funding from non maintained providers. What should we do?<a id="allocatedelcs" name="allocatedelcs">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>It is the responsibility of <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> to ensure that all eligible institutions receive <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> funding and the <abbr title="Department for Education and Skills">DfES</abbr> is unable to provide further funding to cover any shortfalls. If an institution has not received money they are entitled to, then we strongly recommend that their allocation for the following academic year is adjusted upwards to take this into account.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>Are all private and voluntary nurseries entitled to an <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocation?<a id="privateelc" name="privateelc">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>No. We have given specific guidance to <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> about making allocations to private and voluntary nurseries. It is the responsibility of the <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> to ensure that they implement the guidance and act accordingly. The current <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Helpdesk/eLCGuidance20052006.htm" title="eLC allocation guidance"><abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> allocation guidance is available</a>.</p>

<div class="clearrighttiny">&nbsp;</div><div class="floatright"><span class="accesstext"> | </span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

<h4>Can LEAs restrict nursery funding to maintained nurseries?<a id="restrictnursery" name="restrictnursery">&nbsp;</a></h4>

<p>No. All eligible nurseries regardless of whether they are maintained, private or voluntary must be considered equally and fairly when making allocations. This is to ensure that no child benefiting from the Nursery Grant Scheme is disadvantaged.</p>
