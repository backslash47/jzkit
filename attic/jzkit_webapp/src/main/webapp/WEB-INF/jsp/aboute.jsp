<p>The Government has set aside <strong>substantial funds</strong> for your school to spend on multimedia resources in the form of <strong><abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr></strong>. The money is distributed from central Government via <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> to individual schools, which decide locally how to spend it.*</p>

<p>Every school has an appointed <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> budget-holder holder (eg your head, head of department, Bursar or ICT coordinator). All teachers are invited to recommend resources for purchase. </p>
<p>Here at <a href="<%=base_dir%>">Curriculum Online</a> you'll find the definitive list of the multimedia resources that your school can buy with its <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money. All the resources here are geared to the subjects taught in schools in England. </p>

In addition a further &pound;125 million has been allocated over the next two years; &pound;75 million in 2006-07 and &pound;50 million in 2007-08 will be ring-fenced and only available for spending on Curriculum Online approved products and services.</p>

<h3><abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr> in a nutshell.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs?</abbr></strong> Money set aside for your school to spend on multimedia resources. Multimedia resources are generally defined as items of educational software designed to support the teaching of the curriculum in England. They cannot be spent on hardware such as computers or projectors. Find out about <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Helpdesk/whatisamultimediaresource.htm">multimedia resources</a> here.

</li><li><strong>How do I choose a resource?</strong> View the <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Howto/EvaluatingResources.htm">evaluating resources page</a> for more tips.
</li><li><strong>How much money?</strong> &pound;330million between 2002/3 and 2005/6. 
</li><li><strong>Which schools?</strong> Funding is available for all Government-funded nursery, primary and secondary education, up to and including Key Stage 4. 
</li><li><strong>Where's our money?</strong> Your school should be receiving funds already. Check with your <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> budget-holder or LEA. 
</li><li><strong>How is the money allocated?</strong> For further details on <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money, view the <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/Helpdesk/ismyschoolreceivingfunding.htm">funding page</a>.
</li><li><strong>How do I use <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>?</strong> Search this site for the resource(s) you want. Ask your <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> budget for approval, then order direct from the supplier (details supplied), saying you are using <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>. 

</li><li><strong>Can I buy through the website?</strong> All purchases are made direct from suppliers; no transactions take place through the site.
</li><li><strong>When do we have to spend our <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>?</strong>All Standards Fund grants must be spent by the end of the academic year (31st August) to ensure their effective use. If the money has not been spent by the deadline, the <abbr title="Department for Education and Skills">DfES</abbr> will reclaim the money from <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEAs</abbr> so it can be redistributed to other areas. In practise "spent" means that schools must have either placed orders for resources or paid for ordered resources by 31 August. If an invoice is yet to be received and/or paid prior to 31 August, then the expenditure should be recorded as "committed" in the school accounts. The outstanding invoices can then be paid after 31 August. </li></ul>
<p>* In some cases, schools may decide to pool their allotted <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money in order to make larger purchases for shared use. Schools may also decided to authorise their <abbr title="Local Education Authority">LEA</abbr> or <abbr title="Regional Broadband Consortium">RBC</abbr> to spend <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money on their behalf - for example, to obtain a greater diversity of products or to make bulk purchases.</p>
