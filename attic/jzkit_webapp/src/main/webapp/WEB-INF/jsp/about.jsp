<h2>About Curriculum Online</h2>

<strong>What is Curriculum Online?</strong> 
<p>Curriculum Online is central to the Government's drive to transform teaching and learning in schools by improving access to <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> and multimedia resources for all pupils. </p>
<p>To help bring about this aim, the Government has set aside substantial funds in the form of <a href="<%=base_dir%>/abouteLearningCredits"><abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr></a>. This <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> money goes straight to your school to spend on multimedia resources. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk">http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a><br/>This website exists to bring teaching professionals and multimedia resources together. </p>
<p>It offers you easy, pinpoint <a href="<%=base_dir%>">searching</a> through all the thousands of multimedia resources which can be bought with <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>, as well as resources that are free. All these resources are from reputable <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/SupplierAZ/A-ZIndex.htm">suppliers</a>, and aligned with the curriculum of subjects taught in schools in England. </p>

<p><strong>Easier searching</strong></p>
We have recently redesigned this site to help you search for the right resource in as targeted and simple a way as possible. You can now search:
<ul>
<li>by subject or title of resource</li>
<li>by size</li>
<li>e.g. from a single lesson to a whole school resource</li>
<li>by supplier (using the A-Z directory of suppliers)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also limit your search to a specific area such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr></li>
<li>Foundation/Early years</li>
<li>Free resources</li>
<li>Interactive whiteboard resources</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Buying a multimedia resource</strong><br/>No transactions take place directly through the site. To buy a resource using <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>, you just need the approval of your <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLC</abbr> budget holder (eg your head of department or <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> co-ordinator). Then you order direct from a supplier, informing them that you are using <abbr title="eLearning Credits">eLCs</abbr>. </p>
<p>You'll find listed resources for all the core subjects of the curriculum as taught in schools in England, and new subjects are being added regularly. All the suppliers are now listed in a handy new A-Z directory.</p>
<p><strong>Extra features <br/></strong>The site has a number of additional features that you can benefit from when you <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/LoginRegister/Register.htm">register</a> on the site. When searching for the right resources to suit your needs, you can keep a record of possible recommendations for purchase by using the <a href="http://curriculumonline.gov.uk/WishList/WishList.htm">WishList</a> facility. Soon you'll be able to email a colleague your list without leaving the site too. </p>
<p>To help make tracking down the right resource even easier, you'll find many have been given independent evaluations, star ratings and/or teacher reviews. All teachers are invited to add their own reviews of resources they have used.</p>
